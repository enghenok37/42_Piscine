## How to Use

To explore or test the projects:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the desired project folder:
   ```bash
   cd 42_Piscine/C00/ex00
   ```

3. Compile the code using `gcc`:
   ```bash
   gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror <source_file>.c -o <output_name>
   ```

4. Run the compiled program:
   ```bash
   ./<output_name>
   ```
